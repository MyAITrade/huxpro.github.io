Stocks, like individuals, have a character and a personality. Some are high-strung, nervous, and jumpy, others are forthright, direct, logical.

A skillful trader comes to know and respect individual securities. Their action is predictable under varying sets of conditions.
When a stock gets into a definite trend, it works automatically and consistently along certain lines throughout the progress of its move.

To invest or speculate successfully, one must form an opinion as to what the next move of importance will be in a given stock.
Familiarize yourself with a stock, or different groups of stocks, and if you figure the timing element correctly in conjunction with your records,
sooner or later you will be able to determine when a major move is due.
