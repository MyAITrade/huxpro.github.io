## Stock Trends Theory

This chart is based on the complete Livermore Trading System, developed by over his legendary 45 years career trading the stock market.
It deals with the details and secrets of the stock trading system that brought about Livermore’s amazing and unbridled success on Wall Street.

> “Whenever I have had the patience to wait for the market to arrive at what I call a ‘Pivotal Point’ before I started to trade;
I have always made money in my operations.”  – Livermore

Livermore was the first person to use the term Pivotal Point and incorporate it as an important part of his trading system. So we will introduce them in detail below.

### Different Trends

Jesse Livermore separates the stock trends into Secondary Rally, Natural Rally, Upward Trend, Downward Trend, Natural Reaction and Secondary Reaction.

In this software, we use trend column to stand for the trend status of the stock and it just has below four values:
* Upward: stands for upward trend.
* Downward: stands for downward trend.
* Rally: stands for natural rally.
* Reaction: stands for natural reaction.

### How to define stock trends

Jesse Livermore is strictly adhering to the six point movement to be used as a basis for Pivotal Point.
But this software uses AI technologies and calculate specific point movement for the stock to define the Pivotal Point based on historical prices of the stock.
This software uses green line to stand for upward trend or natural rally and uses red line to stand for downward trend or natural reaction.

When recording in the Natural Rally and a price is reached that is three or more points above the last price recorded in the Natural Rally,
then that price should be entered in the Upward Trend.

When recording in the Natural Reaction and a price is reached that is three or more points below the last price recorded in the Natural Reaction,
then that price should be entered in the Downward Trend.

When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points (this software uses AI to calculate the specific points for the stock),
after you have been recording prices in the Upward Trend, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Reaction,
and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction.

When a reaction occurs to an extent of approximately six points (this software uses AI to calculate the specific points for the stock),
after you have been recording prices in the Natural Rally, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Reaction,
and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is lower than the last recorded price in the Natural Reaction.
In case a price is made which is lower than the last recorded price in the Downward Trend, you would then record that price in the Downward Trend.

When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points (this software uses AI to calculate the specific points for the stock),
after you have been recording prices in the Downward Trend, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally,
and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally.

When a rally occurs to an extent of approximately six points (this software uses AI to calculate the specific points for the stock),
after you have been recording prices in the Natural Reaction, you then start to record those prices in the Natural Rally,
and continue to do so every day thereafter that the stock sells at a price which is higher than the last recorded price in the Natural Rally.
In case a price is made which is higher than the last recorded price in the Upward Trend, you would then record that price in the Upward Trend.

When you start to record figures in the Natural Reaction and a price is reached that is lower than the last recorded figure in the Downward Trend
then that price should be entered in red line in the Downward Trend.

The same rule applies when you are recording figures in the Natural Rally and a price is reached that is higher than the last price recorded
in the Upward Trend, then you would cease recording in the Natural Rally and record that price in green line in the Upward Trend.

The last price recorded in the Downward or Upward Trend becomes a Pivotal Point as soon as you begin to record prices in the Natural Rally or Natural Reaction.
After a rally or reaction has ended you start to record again in the reverse trend, and the extreme price made in the previous column then becomes another Pivotal Point.
It is after two Pivotal Points have been reached that these records become of great value to you in helping you anticipate correctly the next movement of importance.

### Reversal Pivotal Point

Definition: A change in basic market direction — the perfect psychological time at the beginning of a new move, it is a major change in the basic trend.
It is the start of a new direction in trend for the stock. Reversal Pivotal Points usually came after long term trending moves.

In this software, we uses green dotted point to stand for high pivotal point, red dotted point to stand for low pivotal point and yellow dotted point to stand for
reversal pivotal point.

### How to look at the stock behave after crossing the Pivotal Point

For the Livermore stock trend chart, this software provides daily candlestick to help you look at how the stock performs after crossing the Pivotal Point.
You can use the expand button in the top right to expand the daily candlestick chart and it will show the daily candlestick chart near the pivotal point
 after you select the pivotal point.

## Trade Rules

Livermore makes it a point to inform us that he never uses the words “bullish” or “bearish” when discussing the market.
He feels that those words have powerful and long term connotations attached to them that lead to clouded judgement.
He prefers to us the terms “upward trend” and “downward trend” because he feels that it is easier to reverse a position
when these less serious terms are attached to it.

If you don’t do your own homework, you won’t really learn from your experience.
Livermore illustrates that everything that happens in the markets has happened before.
The more studying you do into past and current price action and patterns, the better equipped you will be to identify,understand and profit from a given situation.
Don’t try and anticipate what the market will do next, simply go with the evidence of what the market is telling you and presenting to you.

But bear in mind, when using Pivotal Points to anticipate movements,that if the stock does not perform as it should after crossing the Pivotal Point,
this is an important danger signal that must be heeded immediately.
