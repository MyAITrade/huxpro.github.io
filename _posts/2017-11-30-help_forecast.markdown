## How to Forecast Option Price?

### Forecast Implied Volatility

When forecasting implied volatility, there are four things to consider:

1. Make sure you can determine whether implied volatility is high or low and whether it is rising or falling.
Remember, as implied volatility increases, option premiums become more expensive.
As implied volatility decreases, options become less expensive. As implied volatility reaches extreme highs or lows, it is likely to revert back to its mean.

2. If you come across options that yield expensive premiums due to high implied volatility,
understand that there is a reason for this. Check the news to see what caused such high company expectations and high demand for the options.
It is not uncommon to see implied volatility plateau ahead of earnings announcements, merger and acquisition rumors, product approvals and other news events.
Because this is when a lot of price movement takes place, the demand to participate in such events will drive option prices higher.
Keep in mind that after the market anticipated event occurs, implied volatility will collapse and revert back to its mean.

3. When you see options trading with high implied volatility levels, consider selling strategies.
As option premiums become relatively expensive, they are less attractive to purchase and more desirable to sell.
Such strategies include covered calls, naked puts, short straddles and credit spreads.
By contrast, there will be times when you discover relatively cheap options, such as when implied volatility is trading at or near relative to historical lows.
Many option investors use this opportunity to purchase long-dated options and look to hold them through a forecasted volatility increase.

4. When you discover options that are trading with low implied volatility levels, consider buying strategies.
With relatively cheap time premiums, options are more attractive to purchase and less desirable to sell.
Such strategies include buying calls, puts, long straddles and debit spreads.

So you can set your expected stock price at option expiration to forecast the implied volatility.
