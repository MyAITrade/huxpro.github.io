## Stock Dashboard Functions

In the dashboard page, we will show energy, options and high/low prices chart for you to let you know the stock status.

### Energy

There is strength behind to make the stock price movement.
We use rise energy to stand for the strength that makes the stock price up and
fall energy to stand for the strength that makes the stock price down.

From time period perspective, we separate it into three: short term, mid term and long term. The difference is that they use different time period to calculate the energy.
Short term uses 5 days as time period, mid term uses 10 days as time period and long term uses 20 days as time period.

You can choose different time period according to how long or how often you trade the stock.
If you just hold the stock for a short time period, you can use short term chart to decide whether to long it or short it.

#### How to Use Energy Chart

You can use energy chart to help you make the decision about long the stock or short the stock.
For example, if the rise energy is always over the fall energy, then you shouldn't short it during this time period.


### Options

Open interest tells you the total number of option contracts that are currently open -
in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.

Open interest gives you key information regarding the liquidity of an option. If there is no open interest for an option, there is no secondary market for that option.
When options have large open interest, it means they have a large number of buyers and sellers,
and an active secondary market will increase the odds of getting option orders filled at good prices.
So, all other things being equal, the bigger the open interest, the easier it will be to trade that option at a reasonable spread between the bid and ask.

For the stock options, we use define below terms:
* Long Strength: the total dollar market value of all the open interest call options
* Short Strength: the total dollar market value of all the open interest put options
* Long Active: the total dollar market value of all the volume of call options
* Short Active: the total dollar market value of all the volume of put options

### High/Low Prices

This chart just shows the high and low price occurrences to let you know how this stock performs.
