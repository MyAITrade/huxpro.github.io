## Stock Dashboard Functions

In the dashboard page, we will show energy, options and high/low prices chart for you to let you know the stock status.

### Energy

There is strength behind to make the stock price movement.

EC measures the strength of market by comparing the average increase over the average decrease over a period of time to make a forecast of future market trends.
Its value range is [-50,50]. If the value is greater than 0, it indicates a strong market during this time.
If the value is less than 0, it indicates a week market during this time.

EC5: Relative Strength Index within 5 days, its change is faster, more sensitive, can be used to make a rebound.
If more than 40 or less than -40, we must be careful that the market is about to rebound.

EC20: Relative Strength Index within 20 days, its change is relatively slow, and can be used as a basis for short or long.
If greater than 0, it indicates a strong market that you can long the stock.
If less than 0, it indicates a strong market that you can short the stock.
It also has a rebound feature, if more than 20 or less than -20, then we must be careful that the market is about to rebound.

ATR: The relative volatility, used to measure the relative size of the stock volatility.
A value above 0 indicates that it has relatively large volatility, a value less than 0 indicates that it has relatively small volatility.
When ATR <-20, it indicates that the market is going to enter a period of large volatility.

#### How to Use Energy Chart

You can use energy chart to help you make the decision about long the stock or short the stock.
For example, if the rise energy is always over the fall energy, then you shouldn't short it during this time period.


### Options

Open interest tells you the total number of option contracts that are currently open -
in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.

Open interest gives you key information regarding the liquidity of an option. If there is no open interest for an option, there is no secondary market for that option.
When options have large open interest, it means they have a large number of buyers and sellers,
and an active secondary market will increase the odds of getting option orders filled at good prices.
So, all other things being equal, the bigger the open interest, the easier it will be to trade that option at a reasonable spread between the bid and ask.

For the stock options, we use define below terms:
* Long Strength: the total dollar market value of all the open interest call options
* Short Strength: the total dollar market value of all the open interest put options
* Long Active: the total dollar market value of all the volume of call options
* Short Active: the total dollar market value of all the volume of put options
