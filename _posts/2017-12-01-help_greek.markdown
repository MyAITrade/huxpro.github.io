## Option Greeks

### Delta

Simply, option delta measures how much an option's price moves compared to a dollar move in the underlying.
Technically, “Delta is the first derivative (or slope) of the price curve of an option.”

Delta is expressed as a number between -1 and 1. More specifically, a call option delta will range from 0 to 1 and a put option delta will range from -1 to 0.
For example, if you are long a call on TOP with a delta of 0.50 and the underlying makes the move up from $50.00 to $51.00,
your option would now be worth $2.50. The delta told us that since the underlying increased by $1, it would increase the option price $0.50.

### Gamma

Gamma measures how much the delta will change when the underlying moves $1.
For example: TOP is currently trading at $50, and you are long the 60 call with a delta of 0.30 and a gamma of 0.02.
If TOP moves to $51 the delta will increase to 0.32.

### Vega

Implied volatility is always expressed as a percentage. Vega is always expressed as a dollar amount.
A 1% increase in volatility will raise the option's price by the vega.

You have a long call on The Option Prophet (sym: TOP) with a premium of $5.50, vega of 0.20, and an implied volatility of 18%.
If the implied volatility increases to 21%, your long call is now worth $6.10.

### Theta

Theta is expressed as a negative number in terms of dollars. As each day ticks by the option's price will drop by the theta.

For example, you have an Option Prophet (sym: TOP) long call at a price of $5.50 and a theta of -0.35.
The next day our long call would be worth $5.15 and the day after $4.80.
Theta will continue to drop the option price until it reaches expiration.
